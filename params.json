{"name":"Plda","tagline":"Parallel C++ implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation ","body":"# Introduction #\r\n\r\nPlda is a parallel C++ implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (1,2). We are expecting to present a highly optimized parallel implemention of the Gibbs sampling algorithm for the training/inference of LDA (3). The carefully designed architecture is expected to support extensions of this algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe will release an enhanced parallel implementation of LDA, named as PLDA+ (1), which can improve scalability of LDA by signiﬁcantly reducing the unparallelizable communication bottleneck and achieve good load balancing.\r\n\r\n# Requirement #\r\n  * Parallel lda must be run in linux environment with g++ compiler and mpich2-1.0.8 installed.\r\n\r\n# Quick Start #\r\n\r\n## Installation #\r\n  * Install mpich2\r\n      * Download mpich2-1.0.8.tar.gz\r\n        * `wget http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/1.0.8/mpich2-1.0.8.tar.gz`\r\n      * Extract it to a path\r\n        * `./configure`\r\n        * `make && make install`\r\n      * After installing, you will find some binaries and scripts in $PATH. Test by running `mpd` to see if it exists\r\n  * Configure mpich2\r\n    * Create password file `~/.mpd.conf` with access mode 600 (rw-------) in home directory. The file should contain a single line `MPD_SECRETWORD=PASSWORD`. Because you may have many  machines, you must do this on each machine.\r\n      * `touch ~/.mpd.conf`\r\n      * `chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf`\r\n      * `cat \"MPD_SECRETWORD=anypassword\" > ~/.mpd.conf`\r\n    * Pick one machine as the master and startup mpd(mpi daemon)\r\n      * `mpd --daemon --listenport=55555`\r\n    * Other machines act as slave and must connect to the master\r\n      * `mpd --daemon -h serverHostName -p 55555`\r\n    * Check whether the environment is setup successfully: on master, run `mpdtrace`, you will see all the slaves. If no machines show up, you must check your mpi setup and refer to mpich2 user manual.\r\n  * Install plda\r\n    * Download and build plda\r\n     * `git clone https://github.com/obdg/plda.git`\r\n     * `cd plda`\r\n     * `make all`\r\n    * You will see a binary file `lda`, `mpi_lda` and `infer` generated in the folder\r\n    * We use mpich2 builtin compiler mpicxx to compile, it is a wrap of g++.\r\n\r\n## Data Format #\r\n  * Data is stored using a sparse representation, with one document per line. Each line is the words of this document together with the word count. The format of the data file is:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    <word1> <word1_count> <word2> <word2_count> <word3> <word3_count> ...\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    ```\r\n  * Each word is an arbitrary string, but it is not expected to contain space/newline or other special characters.\r\n  * Example: Suppose there are two documents. The first one is `\"a is a character\"`; The second one is `\"b is a character after a\"`. Then the datafile would look like:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    a 2 is 1 character 1\r\n    a 2 is 1 b 1 character 1 after 1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Usage and Examples #\r\n  * Train\r\n      * `./lda --num_topics 2 --alpha 0.1 --beta 0.01 --training_data_file testdata/test_data.txt --model_file /tmp/lda_model.txt --burn_in_iterations 100 --total_iterations 150`\r\n      * After training completes, you will see a file `/tmp/lda_model.txt` generated. This file stores the training result. Each line is the topic distribution of a word. The first element is the word string, then its occurrence count within each topic. You could use view\\_model.py to convert the model to a readable text.\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Train parallelly\r\n      * Prepare data the same as the single processor version.\r\n      * `mpiexec -n 5 ./mpi_lda --num_topics 2 --alpha 0.1 --beta 0.01 --training_data_file testdata/test_data.txt --model_file /tmp/lda_model.txt --total_iterations 150`\r\n      * The input and output are the same with single processor version.\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Training flags\r\n      * `alpha`: Suggested to be 50/number\\_of\\_topics\r\n      * `beta`: Suggested to be 0.01\r\n      * `num_topics`: The total number of topics.\r\n      * `total_iterations`: The total number of GibbsSampling iterations.\r\n      * `burn_in_iterations`: After --burn\\_in\\_iterations iteration, the model will be almost converged. Then we will average models of the last (total\\_iterations-burn\\_in\\_iterations) iterations as the final model. This only takes effect for single processor version. For example: you set total\\_iterations to 200, you found that after 170 iterations, the model is almost converged. Then you could set burn\\_in\\_iterations to 170 so that the final model will be the average of the last 30 iterations.\r\n      * `model_file`: The output file of the trained model.\r\n      * `training_data_file`: The training data.\r\n      * Inferring flags:\r\n      * `alpha` and `beta` should be the same with training.\r\n      * `total_iterations`: The total number of GibbsSampling iterations for an unseen document to determine its word topics. This number needs not be as much as training, usually tens of iterations is enough.\r\n      * `burn_in_iterations`: For an unseen document, we will average the document\\_topic\\_distribution of the last (total\\_iterations-burn\\_in\\_iterations) iterations as the final document\\_topic\\_distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  * Infer unseen documents:\r\n      * `./infer --alpha 0.1 --beta 0.01 --inference_data_file testdata/test_data.txt --inference_result_file /tmp/inference_result.txt --model_file /tmp/lda_model.txt --total_iterations 15 --burn_in_iterations 10`\r\n\r\n# Citation #\r\n\r\nIf you wish to publish any work based on plda, please cite our paper as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZhiyuan Liu, Yuzhou Zhang, Edward Y.
